      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        BlockMate was created to give you control over your time online.  
        Ads, pop-ups, and endless distractions shouldnâ€™t decide how you spend your day.  
        We believe everyone deserves a calmer, ad-free internetâ€”without paying a cent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping BlockMate free takes time and resources.  
        Your support keeps updates coming and helps us fulfill the dream of a distraction-free web for all.
